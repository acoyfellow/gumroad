          Archiving helps you hide your product from most of Gumroad without deleting it completely, thus preventing
          adverse consequences like losing ongoing sales.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Archived products will not show while creating new discounts, upsells, or affiliates, and will be hidden from
          your profile. You will be able to see past sales or edit existing checkout options and affiliates for these
          products though.
        </p>
        <p>
          If needed, you can unarchive them from the “Archived” tab which is visible only if you have an archived
          product.

          The <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/affiliated">Affiliated tab</a> is currently the closest thing to a
          "Dashboard for Affiliates" on Gumroad.{" "}

        <p>Once a Gumroad creator adds you as an affiliate, you should see the affiliated product here. </p>
        <p>
          Please note that you cannot remove yourself as an affiliate for any product; you will have to contact the
          product's creator for that.
