        <h3>Audio</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>AIFF</li>
          <li>AAC</li>
          <li>MP3</li>
          <li>VBR</li>
          <li>ALAC</li>
          <li>WAV</li>
          <li>Audible</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Video </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>H.264</li>
          <li>M4V</li>
          <li>MP4</li>
          <li>MOV</li>

        <h3>Books, etc.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>PDF</li>
          <li>EPUB</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Optimizing a PDF for Mobile:</h3>
        <p>
          Some customers would rather download ebooks to their devices instead of using the Gumroad app. For an
          optimized customer service experience, consider uploading multiple ebook formats. Most importantly, always
          upload a PDF version, as most devices can easily display them and don’t require third-party software such as
          .epub or .mobi file formats.
        </p>
        <h3>PDF Settings</h3>
        <p>
          Set the page size to 6x9" and use a 12pt font for the body. Regular PDF defaults tend to make them hard to
          read on mobile because they are generally optimized for print.
