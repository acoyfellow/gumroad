          For audio files, metadata can give you everything from the track’s title and credits to album art. Then it’s a

          You can enter metadata on tracks using metadata encoder software (there are lots of paid and free options out
          there), or you can enter what you want in iTunes manually.

          If you’ve already entered even a little bit of metadata into your audio files, don’t worry. We won’t override
          anything. We’ll leave those tracks alone. Check the settings in your music or recording software to see if
          it's adding any metadata. If so, either toggle that option off or make sure that everything you want to
          include will be provided when you export.
